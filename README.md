# 2048-HarmonyOS-Watch

# Introduction
2048 is an easy and fun puzzle game. Number 2 or 4 will appear on two random squares at the start of the game. When swiping up, down, left and right to operate, the numbers on the screen will slide in the corresponding direction, the same numbers will be added together, and then randomly generate 2 or 4 on a blank grid. If the grid is full and the grid can no longer be merged by swiping, the game is over. You can play the game on Huawei HarmonyOS Watch 3.
